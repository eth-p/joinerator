# Joinerator (Prototype)
The initial JavaScript prototype for [Joinerator](https://github.com/eth-p/joinerator).

**DO NOT USE THIS VERSION.**  
It is inferior to the Rust build in every possible way.

- It's slower.
- It requires a NodeJS runtime.
- It has less features.
- It has little documentation.
